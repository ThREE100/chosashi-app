## 第1問

```text
Create an Instagram feed image, portrait layout, EXACTLY 1080x1440 pixels (3:4).

STYLE: soft Japanese watercolor-like illustration with a bright pastel sky (light blue, cream, and pale yellow), gentle clouds, clean outlines, consistent with the note.com explainer-column header images of the same series. Layout: the title block in the upper part (between y=120px and y=620px), the single character at the bottom center (about y=760px to y=1360px), and the topic scenes fading softly into the left and right edges.
Fill the whole canvas with the pastel sky and soft clouds.

CHARACTERS (critical): this header image features ONE character only: the main character (MC) shown in the attached character-specification images (キャラクターシート_MC-01, MC-02, MC-03, MC-04). Do NOT draw トリ先生 (the bird teacher), 藍子, or any other character, person, or animal besides this one MC character. Follow the attached MC character sheets exactly and do not redesign her: copy her face, hairstyle, hair color, outfit, and proportions from the sheets, and do not invent or change any of them. Place her at the bottom center. POSE IS NOT FIXED: do not copy any pose from the attached images or from earlier header images; let her take a free, natural pose of your own choosing that fits the topic and suits her (for example standing, sitting, leaning, gesturing, or holding a small prop), and choose a different pose each time this image is generated. Keep her fully visible, with her face clear of the title text, and keep her hairstyle exactly as in the attached images. Keep her human anatomy strictly correct: exactly one head, one torso, two arms (one left, one right) and two hands in total, each hand with exactly five fingers; never draw extra arms, hands, or fingers, floating or duplicated hands, arms not growing from the shoulders, or fused hands; check that every shoulder, elbow, and wrist connects naturally.

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENT: All text must be rendered in standard Japanese only, using hiragana, katakana, Jōyō (regular Japanese) kanji, and no Latin letters anywhere in the image. The only digits allowed are the half-width Arabic digits that appear inside the subtitle string (the year and the question number), written exactly as given; no other digit anywhere. Do NOT use Simplified Chinese characters or Traditional Chinese characters; every glyph must match the standard Japanese Jōyō form exactly. Do NOT render any other non-Japanese script, and no stray or decorative glyphs of any kind, even as small background or texture elements. Reproduce the exact text strings given below verbatim; do not paraphrase, translate, summarize, or substitute any characters. Within this English prompt text, use half-width parentheses ( ) consistently.

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (critical): The entire canvas must be fully opaque from edge to edge. Do NOT generate a transparent or alpha-channel background under any circumstances, even if the output file format supports transparency. Fill the full canvas, including every corner and margin, with the opaque background described above. There must be no checkerboard pattern, no partially transparent area, and no unpainted canvas edge anywhere in the final image.

TEXT (reproduce verbatim, nothing else): a large, bold, rounded Japanese title in two lines at the top center, over a soft white cloud-shaped glow so it reads clearly. Line 1 is dark navy with a pale yellow marker stroke behind it:
占有を引き継ぐと、
Line 2 is larger and red-orange:
何年で取得できる？
Below the title, a light blue rounded pill-shaped subtitle band with navy text:
令和8年度　午後の部　第1問　取得時効
Do not write any other text anywhere in the image: no captions, no labels, no signs with letters, no watermark, no panel numbers.

TOPIC SCENES (illustration only, no text on any object; keep them soft and slightly faded so they never compete with the title or the character):
Left side: a land plot model with a wooden fence and a calendar page, no text
Right side: one hand passing a small key to another hand beside a plot model, no text

INSTAGRAM FEED FORMAT (critical): the profile grid crops the image, so keep every text and every important drawing inside a safe margin of 54px on the left and right and 72px at the top and bottom. Do not draw any account name, handle, URL, hashtag or call-to-action text. Make the title letters slightly larger than in the note version.

LAYOUT: keep a clear, uncluttered zone behind the title and subtitle. Keep the character and the title away from the extreme edges so the image survives center cropping. Do not draw any flowchart, diamond, arrow between boxes, or check mark or cross mark.

Final check before rendering: confirm the image is exactly 1080x1440 portrait (3:4); confirm the only text in the whole image is the two title lines and the subtitle, reproduced exactly as written (cartoon expression marks such as ！ and ？ beside the characters' faces are decoration, are allowed, and are not extra text); scan every kanji glyph and confirm it is the standard Japanese (Jōyō) form, not Simplified Chinese and not Traditional Chinese, paying special attention to the kanji 占、有、引、継、何、年、取、得、令、和、度、午、後、部、第、問、時、効; if any character renders as a Chinese variant, redraw it in the correct Japanese form; confirm the MC character is the only character in the image (no トリ先生, no 藍子), that she matches the attached MC character sheets, and that she keeps the same hairstyle; and confirm the entire canvas, edge to edge, is filled with a fully opaque background with no transparency or alpha channel anywhere. Never delete, redo, or regenerate anything because of an expression mark or a symbol beside a character; deliver the first image as it is.

Reproduce the exact text strings given below verbatim; do not paraphrase, translate, summarize, or substitute any characters. Within this English prompt text, use half-width parentheses ( ) consistently.

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (critical): The entire canvas must be fully opaque from edge to edge. Do NOT generate a transparent or alpha-channel background under any circumstances, even if the output file format supports transparency. Fill the full canvas, including every corner and margin, with the opaque background described above. There must be no checkerboard pattern, no partially transparent area, and no unpainted canvas edge anywhere in the final image.

TEXT (reproduce verbatim, nothing else): a large, bold, rounded Japanese title in two lines at the top center, over a soft white cloud-shaped glow so it reads clearly. Line 1 is dark navy with a pale yellow marker stroke behind it:
工場もダムも、
Line 2 is larger and red-orange:
地目は何になる？
Below the title, a light blue rounded pill-shaped subtitle band with navy text:
令和8年度　午後の部　第6問　地目
Do not write any other text anywhere in the image: no captions, no labels, no signs with letters, no watermark, no panel numbers.

TOPIC SCENES (illustration only, no text on any object; keep them soft and slightly faded so they never compete with the title or the character):
Left side: a factory building and a dam with a calm reservoir, no text
Right side: a school ground with a small track and a rice paddy beside a dry field, no text

INSTAGRAM FEED FORMAT (critical): the profile grid crops the image, so keep every text and every important drawing inside a safe margin of 54px on the left and right and 72px at the top and bottom. Do not draw any account name, handle, URL, hashtag or call-to-action text. Make the title letters slightly larger than in the note version.

LAYOUT: keep a clear, uncluttered zone behind the title and subtitle. Keep the character and the title away from the extreme edges so the image survives center cropping. Do not draw any flowchart, diamond, arrow between boxes, or check mark or cross mark.

Final check before rendering: confirm the image is exactly 1080x1440 portrait (3:4); confirm the only text in the whole image is the two title lines and the subtitle, reproduced exactly as written (cartoon expression marks such as ！ and ？ beside the characters' faces are decoration, are allowed, and are not extra text); scan every kanji glyph and confirm it is the standard Japanese (Jōyō) form, not Simplified Chinese and not Traditional Chinese, paying special attention to the kanji 工、場、地、目、何、令、和、年、度、午、後、部、第、問; if any character renders as a Chinese variant, redraw it in the correct Japanese form; confirm the MC character is the only character in the image (no トリ先生, no 藍子), that she matches the attached MC character sheets, and that she keeps the same hairstyle; and confirm the entire canvas, edge to edge, is filled with a fully opaque background with no transparency or alpha channel anywhere. Never delete, redo, or regenerate anything because of an expression mark or a symbol beside a character; deliver the first image as it is.

Create an Instagram feed image, portrait layout, EXACTLY 1080x1440 pixels (3:4).

STYLE: soft Japanese watercolor-like illustration with a bright pastel sky (light blue, cream, and pale yellow), gentle clouds, clean outlines, consistent with the note.com explainer-column header images of the same series. Layout: the title block in the upper part (between y=120px and y=620px), the single character at the bottom center (about y=760px to y=1360px), and the topic scenes fading softly into the left and right edges.
Fill the whole canvas with the pastel sky and soft clouds.

CHARACTERS (critical): this header image features ONE character only: the main character (MC) shown in the attached character-specification images (キャラクターシート_MC-01, MC-02, MC-03, MC-04). Do NOT draw トリ先生 (the bird teacher), 藍子, or any other character, person, or animal besides this one MC character. Follow the attached MC character sheets exactly and do not redesign her: copy her face, hairstyle, hair color, outfit, and proportions from the sheets, and do not invent or change any of them. Place her at the bottom center. POSE IS NOT FIXED: do not copy any pose from the attached images or from earlier header images; let her take a free, natural pose of your own choosing that fits the topic and suits her (for example standing, sitting, leaning, gesturing, or holding a small prop), and choose a different pose each time this image is generated. Keep her fully visible, with her face clear of the title text, and keep her hairstyle exactly as in the attached images. Keep her human anatomy strictly correct: exactly one head, one torso, two arms (one left, one right) and two hands in total, each hand with exactly five fingers; never draw extra arms, hands, or fingers, floating or duplicated hands, arms not growing from the shoulders, or fused hands; check that every shoulder, elbow, and wrist connects naturally.

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENT: All text must be rendered in standard Japanese only, using hiragana, katakana, Jōyō (regular Japanese) kanji, and no Latin letters anywhere in the image. The only digits allowed are the half-width Arabic digits that appear inside the subtitle string (the year and the question number), written exactly as given; no other digit anywhere.

Reproduce the exact text strings given below verbatim; do not paraphrase, translate, summarize, or substitute any characters. Within this English prompt text, use half-width parentheses ( ) consistently.

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (critical): The entire canvas must be fully opaque from edge to edge. Do NOT generate a transparent or alpha-channel background under any circumstances, even if the output file format supports transparency. Fill the full canvas, including every corner and margin, with the opaque background described above. There must be no checkerboard pattern, no partially transparent area, and no unpainted canvas edge anywhere in the final image.

TEXT (reproduce verbatim, nothing else): a large, bold, rounded Japanese title in two lines at the top center, over a soft white cloud-shaped glow so it reads clearly. Line 1 is dark navy with a pale yellow marker stroke behind it:
附属建物の登記、
Line 2 is larger and red-orange:
どう記録する？
Below the title, a light blue rounded pill-shaped subtitle band with navy text:
令和8年度　午後の部　第12問　附属建物
Do not write any other text anywhere in the image: no captions, no labels, no signs with letters, no watermark, no panel numbers.

TOPIC SCENES (illustration only, no text on any object; keep them soft and slightly faded so they never compete with the title or the character):
Left side: a main house with a small storage shed beside it, no text
Right side: a registry sheet with two rows of entries, no text

INSTAGRAM FEED FORMAT (critical): the profile grid crops the image, so keep every text and every important drawing inside a safe margin of 54px on the left and right and 72px at the top and bottom. Do not draw any account name, handle, URL, hashtag or call-to-action text. Make the title letters slightly larger than in the note version.

LAYOUT: keep a clear, uncluttered zone behind the title and subtitle. Keep the character and the title away from the extreme edges so the image survives center cropping. Do not draw any flowchart, diamond, arrow between boxes, or check mark or cross mark.

Final check before rendering: confirm the image is exactly 1080x1440 portrait (3:4); confirm the only text in the whole image is the two title lines and the subtitle, reproduced exactly as written (cartoon expression marks such as ！ and ？ beside the characters' faces are decoration, are allowed, and are not extra text); scan every kanji glyph and confirm it is the standard Japanese (Jōyō) form, not Simplified Chinese and not Traditional Chinese, paying special attention to the kanji 附、属、建、物、登、記、録、令、和、年、度、午、後、部、第、問; if any character renders as a Chinese variant, redraw it in the correct Japanese form; confirm the MC character is the only character in the image (no トリ先生, no 藍子), that she matches the attached MC character sheets, and that she keeps the same hairstyle; and confirm the entire canvas, edge to edge, is filled with a fully opaque background with no transparency or alpha channel anywhere. Never delete, redo, or regenerate anything because of an expression mark or a symbol beside a character; deliver the first image as it is.

Create an Instagram feed image, portrait layout, EXACTLY 1080x1440 pixels (3:4).

STYLE: soft Japanese watercolor-like illustration with a bright pastel sky (light blue, cream, and pale yellow), gentle clouds, clean outlines, consistent with the note.com explainer-column header images of the same series. Layout: the title block in the upper part (between y=120px and y=620px), the single character at the bottom center (about y=760px to y=1360px), and the topic scenes fading softly into the left and right edges.
Fill the whole canvas with the pastel sky and soft clouds.

CHARACTERS (critical): this header image features ONE character only: the main character (MC) shown in the attached character-specification images (キャラクターシート_MC-01, MC-02, MC-03, MC-04). Do NOT draw トリ先生 (the bird teacher), 藍子, or any other character, person, or animal besides this one MC character. Follow the attached MC character sheets exactly and do not redesign her: copy her face, hairstyle, hair color, outfit, and proportions from the sheets, and do not invent or change any of them. Place her at the bottom center. POSE IS NOT FIXED: do not copy any pose from the attached images or from earlier header images; let her take a free, natural pose of your own choosing that fits the topic and suits her (for example standing, sitting, leaning, gesturing, or holding a small prop), and choose a different pose each time this image is generated. Keep her fully visible, with her face clear of the title text, and keep her hairstyle exactly as in the attached images. Keep her human anatomy strictly correct: exactly one head, one torso, two arms (one left, one right) and two hands in total, each hand with exactly five fingers; never draw extra arms, hands, or fingers, floating or duplicated hands, arms not growing from the shoulders, or fused hands; check that every shoulder, elbow, and wrist connects naturally.

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENT: All text must be rendered in standard Japanese only, using hiragana, katakana, Jōyō (regular Japanese) kanji, and no Latin letters anywhere in the image. The only digits allowed are the half-width Arabic digits that appear inside the subtitle string (the year and the question number), written exactly as given; no other digit anywhere. Do NOT use Simplified Chinese characters or Traditional Chinese characters; every glyph must match the standard Japanese Jōyō form exactly. Do NOT render any other non-Japanese script, and no stray or decorative glyphs of any kind, even as small background or texture elements.

Reproduce the exact text strings given below verbatim; do not paraphrase, translate, summarize, or substitute any characters. Within this English prompt text, use half-width parentheses ( ) consistently.

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT (critical): The entire canvas must be fully opaque from edge to edge. Do NOT generate a transparent or alpha-channel background under any circumstances, even if the output file format supports transparency. Fill the full canvas, including every corner and margin, with the opaque background described above. There must be no checkerboard pattern, no partially transparent area, and no unpainted canvas edge anywhere in the final image.

TEXT (reproduce verbatim, nothing else): a large, bold, rounded Japanese title in two lines at the top center, over a soft white cloud-shaped glow so it reads clearly. Line 1 is dark navy with a pale yellow marker stroke behind it:
筆界特定、
Line 2 is larger and red-orange:
何をしてくれる？
Below the title, a light blue rounded pill-shaped subtitle band with navy text:
令和8年度　午後の部　第18問　筆界特定
Do not write any other text anywhere in the image: no captions, no labels, no signs with letters, no watermark, no panel numbers.

TOPIC SCENES (illustration only, no text on any object; keep them soft and slightly faded so they never compete with the title or the character):
Left side: two neighboring plots with a thin boundary line and a magnifying glass, no text
Right side: a document folder being returned across a counter, no text

INSTAGRAM FEED FORMAT (critical): the profile grid crops the image, so keep every text and every important drawing inside a safe margin of 54px on the left and right and 72px at the top and bottom. Do not draw any account name, handle, URL, hashtag or call-to-action text. Make the title letters slightly larger than in the note version.

LAYOUT: keep a clear, uncluttered zone behind the title and subtitle. Keep the character and the title away from the extreme edges so the image survives center cropping. Do not draw any flowchart, diamond, arrow between boxes, or check mark or cross mark.

Final check before rendering: confirm the image is exactly 1080x1440 portrait (3:4); confirm the only text in the whole image is the two title lines and the subtitle, reproduced exactly as written (cartoon expression marks such as ！ and ？ beside the characters' faces are decoration, are allowed, and are not extra text); scan every kanji glyph and confirm it is the standard Japanese (Jōyō) form, not Simplified Chinese and not Traditional Chinese, paying special attention to the kanji 筆、界、特、定、何、令、和、年、度、午、後、部、第、問; if any character renders as a Chinese variant, redraw it in the correct Japanese form; confirm the MC character is the only character in the image (no トリ先生, no 藍子), that she matches the attached MC character sheets, and that she keeps the same hairstyle; and confirm the entire canvas, edge to edge, is filled with a fully opaque background with no transparency or alpha channel anywhere. Never delete, redo, or regenerate anything because of an expression mark or a symbol beside a character; deliver the first image as it is.

Create an Instagram feed image, portrait layout, EXACTLY 1080x1440 pixels (3:4).

STYLE: soft Japanese watercolor-like illustration with a bright pastel sky (light blue, cream, and pale yellow), gentle clouds, clean outlines, consistent with the note.com explainer-column header images of the same series. Layout: the title block in the upper part (between y=120px and y=620px), the single character at the bottom center (about y=760px to y=1360px), and the topic scenes fading softly into the left and right edges.
Fill the whole canvas with the pastel sky and soft clouds.

CHARACTERS (critical): this header image features ONE character only: the main character (MC) shown in the attached character-specification images (キャラクターシート_MC-01, MC-02, MC-03, MC-04). Do NOT draw トリ先生 (the bird teacher), 藍子, or any other character, person, or animal besides this one MC character. Follow the attached MC character sheets exactly and do not redesign her: copy her face, hairstyle, hair color, outfit, and proportions from the sheets, and do not invent or change any of them. Place her at the bottom center. POSE IS NOT FIXED: do not copy any pose from the attached images or from earlier header images; let her take a free, natural pose of your own choosing that fits the topic and suits her (for example standing, sitting, leaning, gesturing, or holding a small prop), and choose a different pose each time this image is generated. Keep her fully visible, with her face clear of the title text, and keep her hairstyle exactly as in the attached images. Keep her human anatomy strictly correct: exactly one head, one torso, two arms (one left, one right) and two hands in total, each hand with exactly five fingers; never draw extra arms, hands, or fingers, floating or duplicated hands, arms not growing from the shoulders, or fused hands; check that every shoulder, elbow, and wrist connects naturally.

CRITICAL TEXT REQUIREMENT: All text must be rendered in standard Japanese only, using hiragana, katakana, Jōyō (regular Japanese) kanji, and no Latin letters anywhere in the image. The only digits allowed are the half-width Arabic digits that appear inside the subtitle string (the year and the question number), written exactly as given; no other digit anywhere. Do NOT use Simplified Chinese characters or Traditional Chinese characters; every glyph must match the standard Japanese Jōyō form exactly. Do NOT render any other non-Japanese script, and no stray or decorative glyphs of any kind, even as small background or texture elements. Reproduce the exact text strings given below verbatim; do not paraphrase, translate, summarize, or substitute any characters.
